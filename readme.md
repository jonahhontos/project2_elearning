CoreText is an eLearning app that focuses on presenting information one concept at a time, with exercises interspersed throughout. Anyone can create  instructor and user accounts. Instructors can create courses, which consist of a series of concepts and exercises, as well as subject categories. Students can enroll in courses, which show new concepts and exercises as they are completed.
